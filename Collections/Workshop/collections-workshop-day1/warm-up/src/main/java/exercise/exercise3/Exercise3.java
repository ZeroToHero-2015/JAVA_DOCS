/**
 * Created by Radu.Hoaghe on 04/20/2015.
 *
 * Exercise 3: Fill three Set implementations that you know (Hint: they were described during
 *             the earlier presentation) with the List<String> that is given to this class by
 *             its constructor.
 *
 *             Check out the elements that the list mentioned above contains and then, add them
 *             to your three Sets. After this, check out the elements of your Sets. What do you
 *             remark? What could be the reason?
 *
 *             Finally, add to the one of the three Sets some elements
 *             that already exist in the Set (e.g add("that") and add("collection"))
 *
 *             To run your implementation, run the Exercise3Test class.
